This day marks the release of regular decision admissions results from all eight Ivy League schools, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale. In this blog post, we will delve into the history of Ivy Day, when it occurs, and what students can expect on this significant day. Additionally, we will discuss the range of emotions students may feel upon receiving their results and provide advice on what to do next. </p> <p id='p'> Originally, Ivy Day was a ceremony held at some Northeastern schools, including Ivy League universities, to honour academic excellence. The ceremony involved placing an ivy stone on a building, also known as planting the ivy. Over time, Ivy Day evolved into the day when all eight Ivy League schools released their regular admissions decisions, as they share similar educational philosophies. </p> </div> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> Ivy Day typically occurs in late March or early April each year, with Ivy Day 2023 set to occur on March 30, 2023. Ivy Day 2022 saw a record number of applications, likely due to the schools' test-optional policies. Students who applied for early decision or early action would have received their Ivy decision in December or January, depending on the school. On Ivy Day, all eight Ivy League schools announce their results online simultaneously, usually around 5 pm EST or 7 pm EST. However, students may encounter website crashes or long loading periods, so taking a break and trying again later is recommended. </p> <p id='p'> After receiving their Ivy League decision results, students may experience a range of emotions. If accepted, they may feel relief, excitement, and some nervousness. If waitlisted, they may feel hopeful but unsure of what to do next, while rejection may elicit disappointment or frustration. Regardless of the outcome, students still have options. </p> </div> <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qpTDcJv2Luo5ZM0WUfmGwVOBDw5GnQzt' width='886px' height='459px' id='img'> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> For students accepted to an Ivy League school, evaluating the school's financial aid package and considering all other acceptance offers before formally accepting the offer is essential. For those waitlisted, writing a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI) to the school's specific regional admissions officer is recommended. Students rejected from their top schools should not despair, as many excellent colleges are still outside the Ivy League. </p> <p id='p'> In conclusion, Ivy Day is an opportunity for students to celebrate academic achievement and the pursuit of higher education. Although Ivy League universities are highly competitive, students have various options and resources available to help them make their next steps. One of them is SIS Progress, the world's first AI-based platform for college admissions, empowering students to navigate the competitive application process and unlock their path to their dream school. SIS Progress offers personalized guidance, real-time feedback, and a range of features to help students stand out, making it an indispensable resource for any student aspiring to gain acceptance to their desired Ivy League school. </p> </div> </div>",

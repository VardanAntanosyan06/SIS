This day marks the release of regular decision admissions results from all eight Ivy League schools, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale. In this blog post, we will delve into the history of Ivy Day, when it occurs, and what students can expect on this significant day. Additionally, we will discuss the range of emotions students may feel upon receiving their results and provide advice on what to do next. </p> <p id='p'> Originally, Ivy Day was a ceremony held at some Northeastern schools, including Ivy League universities, to honour academic excellence. The ceremony involved placing an ivy stone on a building, also known as planting the ivy. Over time, Ivy Day evolved into the day when all eight Ivy League schools released their regular admissions decisions, as they share similar educational philosophies. </p> </div> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> Ivy Day typically occurs in late March or early April each year, with Ivy Day 2023 set to occur on March 30, 2023. Ivy Day 2022 saw a record number of applications, likely due to the schools' test-optional policies. Students who applied for early decision or early action would have received their Ivy decision in December or January, depending on the school. On Ivy Day, all eight Ivy League schools announce their results online simultaneously, usually around 5 pm EST or 7 pm EST. However, students may encounter website crashes or long loading periods, so taking a break and trying again later is recommended. </p> <p id='p'> After receiving their Ivy League decision results, students may experience a range of emotions. If accepted, they may feel relief, excitement, and some nervousness. If waitlisted, they may feel hopeful but unsure of what to do next, while rejection may elicit disappointment or frustration. Regardless of the outcome, students still have options. </p> </div> <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qpTDcJv2Luo5ZM0WUfmGwVOBDw5GnQzt' id='img2'> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> For students accepted to an Ivy League school, evaluating the school's financial aid package and considering all other acceptance offers before formally accepting the offer is essential. For those waitlisted, writing a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI) to the school's specific regional admissions officer is recommended. Students rejected from their top schools should not despair, as many excellent colleges are still outside the Ivy League. </p> <p id='p'> In conclusion, Ivy Day is an opportunity for students to celebrate academic achievement and the pursuit of higher education. Although Ivy League universities are highly competitive, students have various options and resources available to help them make their next steps. One of them is SIS Progress, the world's first AI-based platform for college admissions, empowering students to navigate the competitive application process and unlock their path to their dream school. SIS Progress offers personalized guidance, real-time feedback, and a range of features to help students stand out, making it an indispensable resource for any student aspiring to gain acceptance to their desired Ivy League school. </p> </div> </div>",

Despite the recent boycott, there are few publications whose rankings have the same influence as US News & World Report. Recently, <a id='a' href='https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/02/22/colleges-quitting-us-news-rankings/11274010002/' target='_blank'>USA Today</a> highlighted the difficulty for students to obtain the data they need to make informed decisions that US News provides. While universities that have withdrawn from the rankings have urged students to utilize publicly available data, many of these data sets contain inaccuracies, making it challenging for families to make informed decisions. Furthermore, a significant amount of data is presented in a manner that is difficult for the average student to comprehend.    </p>    <p id='p'>      One of the most comprehensive sources of centralized data is collected and provided by the <a id='a' href='https://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/EmploymentOutcomes.aspx' target='_blank'>American Bar Association (ABA)</a>, which accredits 199 of the nation's law schools. The <a id='a' href='https://mec.aamc.org/msar-ui/#/landing' target='_blank'>Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)</a>, which accredits medical schools, offers information about medical school admissions requirements (MSARs). In his statement withdrawing from the rankings, Harvard's dean encouraged individuals to refer to the MSARs. For undergraduate colleges and universities, the US Department of Education offers a website called <a id='a' href='https://collegescorecard.ed.gov' target='_blank'>College Scorecard</a>, which reports students' average annual costs, median earnings ten years after enrollment, typical student loan debt, and other information that can be compared among schools.    </p>  </div>  <div id='box'>    <p id='p'>      However, most of these websites have issues as well. A General Accounting Office investigation in November discovered that 91% of colleges and universities misrepresented their expected cost of attendance. Furthermore, a significant portion of the data submitted by universities is not independently verified and is thus not always reliable. Many struggling institutions are also included in these databases and continue to gain accreditation.    </p>    <p id='p'>      The US News rankings have recently come under fire, with top institutions such as Harvard Medical School and Yale Law School withdrawing and a series of allegations that the publication utilizes false data for its listings. Rhode Island School of Design was one of the first undergraduate programs to boycott the rankings. US News has promised to reform law school rankings to address some criticisms. Whether other undergraduate programs will follow RISD's lead remains to be seen.    </p>  </div>  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12ws64Kr7e4mE_nWqN56VaxDVIj34eGEh' id='img2'>  <div id='box'>    <p id='p'>      Following a  <a id='a' href='https://www.crimsoneducation.org/us/blog/admissions-news/risd-pulls-out-of-rankings/' target='_blank'>series of boycotts</a> by top schools, <a id='a' href='https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2023-02-21/u-s-news-acquires-collegeadvisor-com' target='_blank'>US News & World Report has acquired CollegeAdvisor.com.</a>US News has always influenced students' application decisions. With this acquisition, the rankings giant appears to be entering the admissions consulting business more firmly. 'The CollegeAdvisor.com advising platform aligns directly with our mission of providing students with a better understanding of the opaque college admissions process and empowering them with the tools necessary for a successful college admissions journey,' said Eric Gertler, CEO and executive chairman of US News. 'This relationship is a win-win for students everywhere.'        </p>    <p id='p'>      According to <a id='a' href='https://www.highereddive.com/news/us-news-buys-advising-service-CollegeAdvisor/643222/' target='_blank'>Higher Ed Dive,</a> critics of the college admissions system have linked the rankings' difficulties to advising acquisition. 'The move concentrates the commercialization of pre-college counseling in the hands of a company whose arbitrary judgments and questionable advice do not play a constructive role in the admissions process,' said Bob Schaeffer, public education director at FairTest, an organization that advocates for limited standardized testing and equitable admissions, in a statement.    </p>  </div></div>",

    title: "Finding Your Edge: The Ultimate Key to Choosing the Right Extracurricular Activity",
    description: "Extracurricular activities play a significant role in the college application process.",

    html: "<div id='container'>  <img    src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RePDCXvWwf2C5KlBi5XOAxsyMkHzUS-Q'    id='img1'  />    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        1.Choose activities that align with your skills and passions.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Choosing activities that align with skills and passions to excel and demonstrate commitment to extracurricular pursuits is essential. Colleges and universities often look for enthusiastic students committed to their extracurricular activities. To select the appropriate activity, think about what one is good at, what one enjoys doing, and what one wants to learn more about. For example, consider joining a school band or choir or starting a music group if interested in music. It is also worth considering activities that align with long-term goals. If interested in pursuing a career in politics or social justice, consider joining a debate team or participating in a youth advocacy group      </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        2.Keep top-choice colleges in mind.      </p>      <p id='p'>        It is essential to remember the college's priorities and values when choosing extracurricular activities. In the United States, universities emphasize extracurricular activities demonstrating leadership, community involvement, and a commitment to positively impacting the world. On the other hand, in the UK, universities tend to emphasize 'super-curricular' activities related to academic achievements and grades, such as reading, podcasts, debating, and research. Therefore, when selecting extracurricular activities, remember the specific priorities and values of the university to which one is applying.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        3.Focus on quality over quantity.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Admissions officers look for quality extracurricular activities that demonstrate personal growth and impact. Focusing on a few quality activities allows one to dedicate more time and energy to each chosen activity, leading to more significant achievements and personal growth. Juggling multiple activities can result in a lack of meaningful experiences and diluted impact. Therefore, choose activities one is genuinely passionate about and committed to and avoid spreading oneself too thin, leading to burnout and stress.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        4.Seek leadership roles.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Leadership skills are highly valued in college and beyond, and extracurricular activities that demonstrate leadership skills are particularly attractive to college admissions committees. Taking on a leadership role in an extracurricular activity shows the ability to motivate and guide a team, communicate effectively, and make critical decisions. To be successful in a leadership role, take the initiative, build relationships with other members, and express interest in taking on a leadership position. It is also vital to establish trust and respect, which are essential for effective leadership      </p>    </div>    <img    src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1br1iPv6mBYksqaqV16OqE1SJUiVH42ae'    id='img2'  />    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        5.Consider unique and impactful activities.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Top college admissions officers often look for students who demonstrate unique and impactful experiences. Volunteering for a nonprofit organization demonstrates a commitment to a cause and a passion for helping others, providing valuable experience in communication and leadership. Participating in research or internships, especially related to academic interests or career goals, demonstrates seeking opportunities to learn and gain hands-on experience, building meaningful professional connections, and developing essential skills such as project management, fundraising, and marketing.      </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        6.Get involved in the community      </p>      <p id='p'>        Community involvement can enhance your college admissions profile. Research organizations that offer extracurricular activities, volunteer for charity work and attend local events to discover opportunities. Community involvement demonstrates your commitment to making a positive impact and showcases valuable skills, such as teamwork and time management, to college admissions officers. By engaging in community service projects, you can make yourself a more competitive applicant.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        7.Differentiate Your College Application with AI-Driven Extracurricular Selection      </p>      <p id='p'>        By leveraging a range of effective tactics and harnessing the power of the SIS Progress platform, you can position yourself as a highly competitive candidate and increase your chances of securing admission to top-tier universities. The platform utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data to recommend activities that align with your interests, highlight your strengths, and set your application apart. SIS Progress relies on former successful applicants' data, providing invaluable insights and strategies for achieving your goals.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        Final Thoughts      </p>      <p id='p'>        In conclusion, selecting the appropriate extracurricular activities for your college application is a crucial decision that demands thoughtful evaluation. By emphasizing your abilities and interests, seeking out leadership roles, and selecting distinctive and impactful activities, you can differentiate yourself from other applicants and highlight your devotion to personal growth and community involvement. With SIS Progress, you can identify activities that accentuate your skills, passions, and commitment and leave a significant impression on college admissions committees.             </p>    </div></div>",

However,      many of my peers and I attended elite private schools: nationally ranked      overachiever factories designed to churn out catnip for college admission      offices.    </p>    <p id='p'>      These schools are so effective at influencing the admission process that      they further advantage our society’s privileged few and leave everyone      else free to believe that only the most accomplished, most brilliant      students get into prestigious universities. The idea that admission to the      most selective colleges and universities is based on merit presumes that a      fast track to comfort, status and wealth doesn’t exist. But that’s just an      illusion.    </p>    <p id='p'>      I grew up in the Bay Area, where, according to an analysis by Niche, a      school rating database, private high schools      <a        id='a'        href='https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-schools/s/california/?gradeLevel=high&type=charter&type=magnet&type=traditional&type=private'        target='_blank'        >outrank</a      >      even the state’s most competitive public schools.

Kennedy attended what was then the Choate School for boys in      Wallingford, Conn., before heading to Harvard.Pursuing the best secondary      education available has an obvious purpose: getting into a prestigious      university. Private high schools openly market themselves on this goal;      many top schools’ websites boast college matriculation lists that show      dozens of alumni at the best universities in the country. I’m certain that      my high school’s obsessive focus on academic success derived, on some      level, from the need to tell prospective parents that one more senior got      into Stanford that year.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Even the structure of these schools seems designed to service the college      admission process. They often bestow      <a        id='a'        href='https://web.archive.org/web/20220729213942/https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/overview/statistics.html'        target='_blank'        >access to more advanced classes</a      >      than a typical school and offer a wealth of extracurriculars. At my high      school, a club period was‌ even built into ‌our class schedule so that      robotics or model United Nations could meet during the school day,      presumably to help burnish the activities section of our Common      Application. After school, we had time to tack on even more activities,      like sports practice and theater rehearsal.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Where I grew up, attending a private school was likely to facilitate a      significant bump in test scores. Students at private schools in my area      will likely score 33 or 34 on their ACTs (out of a possible 36), as      opposed to top public school students’ 31 or 32. At the top of the pecking      order, that slight increase can help snag an acceptance from a school like      Stanford or Harvard. After all, elite universities are supposed to look      for perfection — or three points from it. But looking good on paper is but      one drop in the inscrutable bucket we call college admissions. Counselors      at elite private high schools have behind-the-scenes access to demystify      admissions for their students. When I was deferred from a school I applied      to early action, I was told that my high school counselor called the      admission officer at the college to ask why, and the person simply      responded that I should keep my A in honors calculus, implying that if I      did, I would get in during regular decision. These counselors frequently      ring elite universities’ admission offices to make the case for their      favorite students. In 2020, Swarthmore College ended this practice after      it found that over 90 percent of counselors calling represented private      high schools. Students at private schools have personal connections with      their counselors, who often in turn have the ears of admission officers at      elite universities across the country.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Private high schools systematize the creation of the consummate college      applicant. When the American educational landscape is so obviously a      pay-to-win game, how can we dare to call it a meritocracy?    </p>    <p id='p'>      Admitting a high proportion of private school students serves elite      universities’ interests. During and after college, graduates from private      schools are likely to outperform their public school peers. For example,      in 2020, The Daily Princetonian reported, two-thirds of Princeton’s      American Rhodes scholars attended private high schools, and the      Association of Boarding Schools bragged in 2010that its alumni are “3,000      percent more likely” to become Rhodes scholars than the average student.      Prestigious postgraduate scholarships — or fancy post graduation jobs —      can help make a college more attractive to its deep-pocketed alumni and      the next crop of prospective students.    </p>    <p id='p'>      On top of that, these exceptional students are often more likely to pay      full tuition. When colleges see private school students, they surely see      high-performing bags of money with test scores that will bump those sweet,      sweet U.S. News and World Report rankings.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Private high schools function to perpetuate cycles of privilege. They also      work. If you had the financial resources, would you deny your kids the      education and opportunities that private high schools can give them?    </p>    <p id='p'>      “Don’t complain; you got into Stanford” resounds in my head any time I      reflect on my high school experience. I am, after all, an example of the      student these private schools strive to create: a high achiever at an      elite university with a paralyzing fear of failure.    </p>    <p id='p'>      But when I look back, my high school’s culture of achievement was really      more a never-ending competition created by the prestigious universities      that reap the rewards from it, the administrators who facilitate it and      the parents who fund it.    </p>    <p id='p'>      The pursuit of prestige — in high school, college and beyond, forever and      always — makes students like me willfully ignore the mental and physical      toll that each step of our “meritocracy” exacts. After all, we’ve earned      it.    </p>    <p id='p'>©The New York Times</p>    <p id='p1'>      Sophie Callcott is a junior at Stanford University, where she studies      history. She has written about education for The Stanford Daily, a student      newspaper there.    </p>  </div></div>"

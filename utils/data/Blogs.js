This day marks the release of regular decision admissions results from all eight Ivy League schools, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale. In this blog post, we will delve into the history of Ivy Day, when it occurs, and what students can expect on this significant day. Additionally, we will discuss the range of emotions students may feel upon receiving their results and provide advice on what to do next. </p> <p id='p'> Originally, Ivy Day was a ceremony held at some Northeastern schools, including Ivy League universities, to honour academic excellence. The ceremony involved placing an ivy stone on a building, also known as planting the ivy. Over time, Ivy Day evolved into the day when all eight Ivy League schools released their regular admissions decisions, as they share similar educational philosophies. </p> </div> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> Ivy Day typically occurs in late March or early April each year, with Ivy Day 2023 set to occur on March 30, 2023. Ivy Day 2022 saw a record number of applications, likely due to the schools' test-optional policies. Students who applied for early decision or early action would have received their Ivy decision in December or January, depending on the school. On Ivy Day, all eight Ivy League schools announce their results online simultaneously, usually around 5 pm EST or 7 pm EST. However, students may encounter website crashes or long loading periods, so taking a break and trying again later is recommended. </p> <p id='p'> After receiving their Ivy League decision results, students may experience a range of emotions. If accepted, they may feel relief, excitement, and some nervousness. If waitlisted, they may feel hopeful but unsure of what to do next, while rejection may elicit disappointment or frustration. Regardless of the outcome, students still have options. </p> </div> <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1AD7vvBdO423sLzpCurCy6HuSxXns4N7c' id='img2'> <div id='box'> <p id='p'> For students accepted to an Ivy League school, evaluating the school's financial aid package and considering all other acceptance offers before formally accepting the offer is essential. For those waitlisted, writing a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI) to the school's specific regional admissions officer is recommended. Students rejected from their top schools should not despair, as many excellent colleges are still outside the Ivy League. </p> <p id='p'> In conclusion, Ivy Day is an opportunity for students to celebrate academic achievement and the pursuit of higher education. Although Ivy League universities are highly competitive, students have various options and resources available to help them make their next steps. One of them is SIS Progress, the world's first AI-based platform for college admissions, empowering students to navigate the competitive application process and unlock their path to their dream school. SIS Progress offers personalized guidance, real-time feedback, and a range of features to help students stand out, making it an indispensable resource for any student aspiring to gain acceptance to their desired Ivy League school. </p> </div> </div>",

    html: "<div id='container'>  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nL7GRaWPdRgucxJflMDrvbgkRRBjhXJV' id='img1'>  <div id='box'>    <h1 id='h1'>      The Troubling State of US University Rankings: Inaccurate Data, Unverified Claims, and Allegations of False Information    </h1>    <p id='p'>      College rankings in the United States face numerous challenges. Despite the recent boycott, there are few publications whose rankings have the same influence as US News & World Report. Recently, <a id='a' href='https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/02/22/colleges-quitting-us-news-rankings/11274010002/' target='_blank'>USA Today</a> highlighted the difficulty for students to obtain the data they need to make informed decisions that US News provides. While universities that have withdrawn from the rankings have urged students to utilize publicly available data, many of these data sets contain inaccuracies, making it challenging for families to make informed decisions. Furthermore, a significant amount of data is presented in a manner that is difficult for the average student to comprehend.    </p>    <p id='p'>      One of the most comprehensive sources of centralized data is collected and provided by the <a id='a' href='https://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/EmploymentOutcomes.aspx' target='_blank'>American Bar Association (ABA)</a>, which accredits 199 of the nation's law schools. The <a id='a' href='https://mec.aamc.org/msar-ui/#/landing' target='_blank'>Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)</a>, which accredits medical schools, offers information about medical school admissions requirements (MSARs). In his statement withdrawing from the rankings, Harvard's dean encouraged individuals to refer to the MSARs. For undergraduate colleges and universities, the US Department of Education offers a website called <a id='a' href='https://collegescorecard.ed.gov' target='_blank'>College Scorecard</a>, which reports students' average annual costs, median earnings ten years after enrollment, typical student loan debt, and other information that can be compared among schools.    </p>  </div>  <div id='box'>    <p id='p'>      However, most of these websites have issues as well. A General Accounting Office investigation in November discovered that 91% of colleges and universities misrepresented their expected cost of attendance. Furthermore, a significant portion of the data submitted by universities is not independently verified and is thus not always reliable. Many struggling institutions are also included in these databases and continue to gain accreditation.    </p>    <p id='p'>      The US News rankings have recently come under fire, with top institutions such as Harvard Medical School and Yale Law School withdrawing and a series of allegations that the publication utilizes false data for its listings. Rhode Island School of Design was one of the first undergraduate programs to boycott the rankings. US News has promised to reform law school rankings to address some criticisms. Whether other undergraduate programs will follow RISD's lead remains to be seen.    </p>  </div>  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1R_oqI25a0PGhKcS1Fb-YufGgI4sQ0ZML' id='img2'>  <div id='box'>    <p id='p'>      Following a  <a id='a' href='https://www.crimsoneducation.org/us/blog/admissions-news/risd-pulls-out-of-rankings/' target='_blank'>series of boycotts</a> by top schools, <a id='a' href='https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2023-02-21/u-s-news-acquires-collegeadvisor-com' target='_blank'>US News & World Report has acquired CollegeAdvisor.com.</a>US News has always influenced students' application decisions. With this acquisition, the rankings giant appears to be entering the admissions consulting business more firmly. 'The CollegeAdvisor.com advising platform aligns directly with our mission of providing students with a better understanding of the opaque college admissions process and empowering them with the tools necessary for a successful college admissions journey,' said Eric Gertler, CEO and executive chairman of US News. 'This relationship is a win-win for students everywhere.'        </p>    <p id='p'>      According to <a id='a' href='https://www.highereddive.com/news/us-news-buys-advising-service-CollegeAdvisor/643222/' target='_blank'>Higher Ed Dive,</a> critics of the college admissions system have linked the rankings' difficulties to advising acquisition. 'The move concentrates the commercialization of pre-college counseling in the hands of a company whose arbitrary judgments and questionable advice do not play a constructive role in the admissions process,' said Bob Schaeffer, public education director at FairTest, an organization that advocates for limited standardized testing and equitable admissions, in a statement.    </p>  </div></div>",

      "Finding Your Edge: The Ultimate Key to Choosing the Right Extracurricular Activity",

      "Extracurricular activities play a significant role in the college application process.",

    html: "<div id='container'>  <img  src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uUEsVCYtVCWTFzNdVMNKx_D49hZgD6nQ'    id='img1'  />    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        1.Choose activities that align with your skills and passions.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Choosing activities that align with skills and passions to excel and demonstrate commitment to extracurricular pursuits is essential. Colleges and universities often look for enthusiastic students committed to their extracurricular activities. To select the appropriate activity, think about what one is good at, what one enjoys doing, and what one wants to learn more about. For example, consider joining a school band or choir or starting a music group if interested in music. It is also worth considering activities that align with long-term goals. If interested in pursuing a career in politics or social justice, consider joining a debate team or participating in a youth advocacy group      </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        2.Keep top-choice colleges in mind.      </p>      <p id='p'>        It is essential to remember the college's priorities and values when choosing extracurricular activities. In the United States, universities emphasize extracurricular activities demonstrating leadership, community involvement, and a commitment to positively impacting the world. On the other hand, in the UK, universities tend to emphasize 'super-curricular' activities related to academic achievements and grades, such as reading, podcasts, debating, and research. Therefore, when selecting extracurricular activities, remember the specific priorities and values of the university to which one is applying.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        3.Focus on quality over quantity.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Admissions officers look for quality extracurricular activities that demonstrate personal growth and impact. Focusing on a few quality activities allows one to dedicate more time and energy to each chosen activity, leading to more significant achievements and personal growth. Juggling multiple activities can result in a lack of meaningful experiences and diluted impact. Therefore, choose activities one is genuinely passionate about and committed to and avoid spreading oneself too thin, leading to burnout and stress.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        4.Seek leadership roles.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Leadership skills are highly valued in college and beyond, and extracurricular activities that demonstrate leadership skills are particularly attractive to college admissions committees. Taking on a leadership role in an extracurricular activity shows the ability to motivate and guide a team, communicate effectively, and make critical decisions. To be successful in a leadership role, take the initiative, build relationships with other members, and express interest in taking on a leadership position. It is also vital to establish trust and respect, which are essential for effective leadership      </p>    </div>    <img    src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1br1iPv6mBYksqaqV16OqE1SJUiVH42ae'    id='img2'  />    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        5.Consider unique and impactful activities.      </p>      <p id='p'>        Top college admissions officers often look for students who demonstrate unique and impactful experiences. Volunteering for a nonprofit organization demonstrates a commitment to a cause and a passion for helping others, providing valuable experience in communication and leadership. Participating in research or internships, especially related to academic interests or career goals, demonstrates seeking opportunities to learn and gain hands-on experience, building meaningful professional connections, and developing essential skills such as project management, fundraising, and marketing.      </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        6.Get involved in the community      </p>      <p id='p'>        Community involvement can enhance your college admissions profile. Research organizations that offer extracurricular activities, volunteer for charity work and attend local events to discover opportunities. Community involvement demonstrates your commitment to making a positive impact and showcases valuable skills, such as teamwork and time management, to college admissions officers. By engaging in community service projects, you can make yourself a more competitive applicant.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        7.Differentiate Your College Application with AI-Driven Extracurricular Selection      </p>      <p id='p'>        By leveraging a range of effective tactics and harnessing the power of the SIS Progress platform, you can position yourself as a highly competitive candidate and increase your chances of securing admission to top-tier universities. The platform utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data to recommend activities that align with your interests, highlight your strengths, and set your application apart. SIS Progress relies on former successful applicants' data, providing invaluable insights and strategies for achieving your goals.            </p>    </div>    <div id='box'>      <p id='p2'>        Final Thoughts      </p>      <p id='p'>        In conclusion, selecting the appropriate extracurricular activities for your college application is a crucial decision that demands thoughtful evaluation. By emphasizing your abilities and interests, seeking out leadership roles, and selecting distinctive and impactful activities, you can differentiate yourself from other applicants and highlight your devotion to personal growth and community involvement. With SIS Progress, you can identify activities that accentuate your skills, passions, and commitment and leave a significant impression on college admissions committees.             </p>    </div></div>",

Competition for coveted spots      is so fierce that while an admission victory can’t be guaranteed, it can      be gamed, if you know how to play. ‌    </p>    <p id='p'>      It worked for me: I attend a prestigious university, Stanford, which      accepted      <a        id='a'        href='https://web.archive.org/web/20220729213942/https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/overview/statistics.html'        target='_blank'        >fewer than 4 percent</a      >      of applicants last year.

However,      many of my peers and I attended elite private schools: nationally ranked      overachiever factories designed to churn out catnip for college admission      offices.    </p>    <p id='p'>      These schools are so effective at influencing the admission process that      they further advantage our society’s privileged few and leave everyone      else free to believe that only the most accomplished, most brilliant      students get into prestigious universities. The idea that admission to the      most selective colleges and universities is based on merit presumes that a      fast track to comfort, status and wealth doesn’t exist. But that’s just an      illusion.    </p>    <p id='p'>      I grew up in the Bay Area, where, according to an analysis by Niche, a      school rating database, private high schools      <a        id='a'        href='https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-schools/s/california/?gradeLevel=high&type=charter&type=magnet&type=traditional&type=private'        target='_blank'        >outrank</a      >      even the state’s most competitive public schools.

Kennedy attended what was then the Choate School for boys in      Wallingford, Conn., before heading to Harvard.Pursuing the best secondary      education available has an obvious purpose: getting into a prestigious      university. Private high schools openly market themselves on this goal;      many top schools’ websites boast college matriculation lists that show      dozens of alumni at the best universities in the country. I’m certain that      my high school’s obsessive focus on academic success derived, on some      level, from the need to tell prospective parents that one more senior got      into Stanford that year.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Even the structure of these schools seems designed to service the college      admission process. They often bestow      <a        id='a'        href='https://web.archive.org/web/20220729213942/https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/overview/statistics.html'        target='_blank'        >access to more advanced classes</a      >      than a typical school and offer a wealth of extracurriculars. At my high      school, a club period was‌ even built into ‌our class schedule so that      robotics or model United Nations could meet during the school day,      presumably to help burnish the activities section of our Common      Application. After school, we had time to tack on even more activities,      like sports practice and theater rehearsal.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Where I grew up, attending a private school was likely to facilitate a      significant bump in test scores. Students at private schools in my area      will likely score 33 or 34 on their ACTs (out of a possible 36), as      opposed to top public school students’ 31 or 32. At the top of the pecking      order, that slight increase can help snag an acceptance from a school like      Stanford or Harvard. After all, elite universities are supposed to look      for perfection — or three points from it. But looking good on paper is but      one drop in the inscrutable bucket we call college admissions. Counselors      at elite private high schools have behind-the-scenes access to demystify      admissions for their students. When I was deferred from a school I applied      to early action, I was told that my high school counselor called the      admission officer at the college to ask why, and the person simply      responded that I should keep my A in honors calculus, implying that if I      did, I would get in during regular decision. These counselors frequently      ring elite universities’ admission offices to make the case for their      favorite students. In 2020, Swarthmore College ended this practice after      it found that over 90 percent of counselors calling represented private      high schools. Students at private schools have personal connections with      their counselors, who often in turn have the ears of admission officers at      elite universities across the country.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Private high schools systematize the creation of the consummate college      applicant. When the American educational landscape is so obviously a      pay-to-win game, how can we dare to call it a meritocracy?    </p>    <p id='p'>      Admitting a high proportion of private school students serves elite      universities’ interests. During and after college, graduates from private      schools are likely to outperform their public school peers. For example,      in 2020, The Daily Princetonian reported, two-thirds of Princeton’s      American Rhodes scholars attended private high schools, and the      Association of Boarding Schools bragged in 2010that its alumni are “3,000      percent more likely” to become Rhodes scholars than the average student.      Prestigious postgraduate scholarships — or fancy post graduation jobs —      can help make a college more attractive to its deep-pocketed alumni and      the next crop of prospective students.    </p>    <p id='p'>      On top of that, these exceptional students are often more likely to pay      full tuition. When colleges see private school students, they surely see      high-performing bags of money with test scores that will bump those sweet,      sweet U.S. News and World Report rankings.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Private high schools function to perpetuate cycles of privilege. They also      work. If you had the financial resources, would you deny your kids the      education and opportunities that private high schools can give them?    </p>    <p id='p'>      “Don’t complain; you got into Stanford” resounds in my head any time I      reflect on my high school experience. I am, after all, an example of the      student these private schools strive to create: a high achiever at an      elite university with a paralyzing fear of failure.    </p>    <p id='p'>      But when I look back, my high school’s culture of achievement was really      more a never-ending competition created by the prestigious universities      that reap the rewards from it, the administrators who facilitate it and      the parents who fund it.    </p>    <p id='p'>      The pursuit of prestige — in high school, college and beyond, forever and      always — makes students like me willfully ignore the mental and physical      toll that each step of our “meritocracy” exacts. After all, we’ve earned      it.    </p>    <p id='p'>©This article was written by Sophie Callcott on Oct. 1, 2022 for the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/' target='_blank' id='a'>New York Times</a>.

Majoring in    computer science offers students a unique opportunity to develop critical    thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills essential in today's    workforce. However, with the benefits come several potential drawbacks that    students should consider before choosing this major.  </p>  <p id='p'>    One of the main challenges associated with computer science is the rigorous    coursework required. <a href='https://www.mtu.edu/cs/what/'>The subject</a> is highly technical and complex, demanding    strong math, analytical, and problem-solving skills. The coursework can be    mentally and physically exhausting, requiring long hours of studying and    coding. Thus, students must be prepared to put in the necessary effort and    dedication to succeed in this field.  </p>  <p id='p'>    However, it is important to note that computer science is not just for those    with a strong math and science background. While these skills are    undoubtedly essential, passion and dedication are equally important.    Students passionate about technology and willing to learn can succeed in    this field, regardless of their background. With the right mindset and    skills, however, computer science can offer a fulfilling and lucrative    career path with <a href='https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm#tab-5'>a median annual salary of $131,490</a>.  </p>  <p id='p'>    Another potential disadvantage is <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html'>the high competition</a> for jobs in the    field. Graduates will be competing with other highly skilled candidates for    the most sought-after positions, which can be stressful and challenging. On    top of that, the constantly evolving field means that students must keep up    with new technologies and trends to remain competitive, which requires    ongoing education and training. This can be particularly challenging for    those who are not passionate about the field or those who struggle with    keeping up with the fast-paced nature of the industry.  </p>  <img  src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1d18Olo_-XERqur38RnEPeirUc0a-Puo6'  id='img2'  />  <p id='p'>    Despite these challenges, majoring in computer science can be an enriching    and exciting career path. This major allows students to work on cutting-edge    technology, tackle complex problems, and contribute significantly to    society. In addition to technical skills, computer science majors develop    various soft skills, including communication, teamwork, and project    management. This is because computer science projects are often    collaborative, requiring individuals to work with others to solve complex    problems. These soft skills are highly valued in the modern workforce and    can be applied in various fields, making computer science graduates    versatile and sought-after candidates.  </p>  <p id='p'>    Furthermore,<a href='https://www.london.ac.uk/news-opinion/london-connection/feature/five-essential-soft-skills-computer-scientist'>computer science offers a range of specializations</a>, allowing    individuals to tailor their degrees to their interests and career goals. For    example, students can specialize in areas such as cybersecurity, game    development, machine learning, or computer graphics. Thus, when considering    a computer science major, students should research the requirements, the    department's curriculum, and the faculty to ensure they fit. They should    also consider internships and research opportunities to gain hands-on    experience and insight into the field. These experiences help students    determine if computer science is their right major and provide them with    valuable skills and connections in the industry.  </p>  <p id='p'>    To summarize, even though the coursework in computer science can be    challenging and highly competitive, students who have a strong passion for    technology and are willing to put in the effort can acquire valuable    technical and interpersonal skills, making them adaptable and highly    desirable candidates for various fields and industries. Finally, prospective    computer science majors should begin researching the program's prerequisites    and curriculum and seek guidance from academic advisors, industry experts,    and alumni early on to make informed decisions before enrolling.  </p></div></div>",

Joanna Kulesza for The New York Times  </p>  <p id='p'>    Lured by the prospect of high-salary, high-status jobs, college students are    rushing in record numbersto study computer science.  </p>  <p id='p'>Now, if only they could get a seat in class.</p>  <p id='p'>    On campuses across the country, from major state universities to small    private colleges, the surge instudent demand for computer science courses is    far outstripping the supply of professors, as the techindustry snaps up    talent. At some schools, the shortage is creating an undergraduate divide of    computing  </p>  <p id='p'></p>  <p id='p'>    haves and have-nots potentially narrowing a path for some minority and    female students to an industrythat has struggled with diversity.  </p>  <p id='p'>    The number of undergraduates majoring in the subject more than doubled from    2013 to 2017, to over106,000, while tenure-track faculty ranks rose about 17    percent, according to the Computing ResearchAssociation, a nonprofit that    gathers data from about 200 universities.  </p>  <p id='p'>    Economics and the promise of upward mobility are driving the student    stampede. While previousgenerations of entrepreneurial undergraduates might    have aspired to become lawyers or doctors, manystudents now are leery of    investing the time, and incurring six-figure debts, to join those    professions.  </p>  <p id='p'>    By contrast, learning computing skills can be a fast path to employment, as    fields as varied asagriculture, banking and genomics incorporate more    sophisticated computing. While the quality ofprograms across the country    varies widely, some computer science majors make six-figure salariesstraight    out of school.  </p>  <p id='p'>    At the University of Texas at Austin, which has a top computer science    program, more than 3,300incoming first-year students last fall sought    computer science as their first choice of major, more thandouble the number    who did so in 2014.  </p>  <img    src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18PdCXZNs8k3VWRQZv7I4Zqp2EEK3zHq4'    id='img2'  />  <p id='p'>    The Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Hall at the    University of Texas at Austin,home to one of the nation's leading computer    science programs. A surge in student demand for the courses isoutstripping    the supply of professors available to teach them. Joanna Kulesza for The New    York Times  </p>  <p id='p'>    The demand is unbounded, said Don Fussell, chairman of the university's    computer sciencedepartment. The university is looking to hire several    tenure-track faculty members in computing this year,he said, but competition    for top candidates is fierce. I know of major departments that interviewed    40candidates, and I don't think they hired anybody.  </p>  <p id='p'>    Although the problem has been building for years, a recent boom is straining    resources at new levels atinstitutions large and small. The situation has    become so acute that Swarthmore College, which wasalready holding lotteries    to select students for computing classes, is now capping the number of    courses  </p>  <p id='p'></p>  <div>    <p id='p'></p>    <p id='p'>      that computer science majors may take. The University of Maryland plans      this fall to make computing alimited enrollment major, which will make it      harder for non-majors to transfer in. At the University ofCalifornia, San      Diego, introductory lecture courses have ballooned to up to 400 students      to accommodateboth majors and non-majors.    </p>    <p id='p'>      As a result of such changes, students on some campuses said they felt shut      out of computer sciencewhile others said they faced overcrowded classes      with overworked professors.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Aafia Ahmad, a sophomore computer science major at U.T. Austin, had hoped      to take an electivecourse in computer security this semester. But when she      tried to sign up during early registration inNovember, the course was      already full. She said that was the case for nearly every computer      scienceelective she wanted. She is now 79th on a waiting list for the      security course.    </p>    <p id='p'>      It's a cutthroat race to register for classes, she said.Some university      leaders said they were concerned that certain measures taken to address      surging    </p>    <p id='p'>      student demand may disadvantage people who are already unrepresented in      computer science including women, African-Americans, Latinos and      low-income, first-generation college students.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Some universities now require incoming students to get accepted into      computer science majors beforethey arrive on campus and make it nearly      impossible for other undergraduates to transfer into themajor. That      approach can favor incoming students from schools with resources like      advancedprogramming courses. It can also favor male students because women      on average are less likely tohave taken a computer science course in high      school.    </p>    <p id='p'>      When you put any kind of barrier in place in terms of access to computer      science majors, it tends toreduce the number of women and students of      color in the program, said Maria Klawe, presidentofHarvey Mudd College, a      private college in Claremont, Calif., that has become a national model      fordiversity in computer science.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Don Fussell, the chairman of the computer science department at the      University of Texas at Austin, said topprograms nationwide were competing      with tech companies to keep their professors and hire Ph.D.s.      JoannaKulesza for The New York Times    </p>    <p id='p'></p>  </div>  <div>    <p id='p'></p>    <p id='p'>      Other experts warned that some students without computing experience may      be rushing into the majorbecause it seems to be trendy and pay well not      because it is the subject that most interests them.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Maybe they are cutting off other options too early, said Richard      Wicentowski, the chairman ofSwarthmore's computer science department.    </p>    <p id='p'>      One solution, he suggested: Universities could treat computer science more      like math courses thatlay the foundations for other majors like data      science and physics. That way, he said, students could learnimportant      computing skills and then apply them to other majors, like literature,      while keeping their jobprospects open.    </p>    <p id='p'>      On some campuses, students have protested measures like course lotteries      and long waiting lists.At Haverford College in Pennsylvania, students put      up posters in the science building on April Fools'    </p>    <p id='p'>      Day, lamenting the dearth of computing teachers. One showed a featureless      face with the caption: This IsWhere I'd Put My New Tenure-Track CS      Professor If I Had One. Students later wrote a letter tocollege officials      pushing for more professors.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Haverford has since opened a search for a new computer science      professor.Some schools are trying to create more hospitable conditions.      Both Harvey Mudd and the University    </p>    <p id='p'>      of Washington in Seattle offer introductory computing courses intended to      attract students with or withoutcomputing experience.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Likewise, Tracy Camp, head of the computer science department at the      Colorado School of Mines apublic university where the number of computer      science majors has more than doubled in recent years said she was      determined not to put in deterrents like capping the major. Instead, she      said, class sizes hadsharply increased.    </p>    <p id='p'>      I don't want to tell a student already at Mines, You can't major in      computer science,' ProfessorCamp said.    </p>    <img      src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GqzBsbD85RiUPKOGV_M1SJxaWgKI-6AR'      id='img2'    />    <p id='p'>      The computer science complex opened in 2013 at U.T. Austin. The number of      incoming students seeking tomajor in the subject more than doubled between      2014 and 2018. Joanna Kulesza for The New York Times    </p>    <p id='p'></p>  </div>  <div>    <p id='p'></p>    <p id='p'>      Still, the pipeline of professors is limited partly because of economics      and partly because universityhiring is geared toward long tenure      appointments, not the latest trends.    </p>    <p id='p'>      High entry-level salaries are luring undergraduates to pick the private      sector over graduate school,limiting the supply of future professors. The      number of graduate students enrolled in computer sciencePh.D. programs has      only inched up in recent years, to nearly 12,700 in 2017 compared with      about 11,000in 2013, according to the Taulbee Survey, an annual report      from the Computing Research Association.    </p>    <p id='p'>      In addition, tech giants and other companies have been poaching professors      and hiring new Ph.D.s.I had a faculty member who came in with an offer      from a bank, and they were told that, with their    </p>    <p id='p'>      expertise, the starting salary would be $1 million to $4 million, said      Greg Morrisett, dean of computingand information science at Cornell      University. There's no way a university, no matter how well off,could      compete with that.    </p>    <img  src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1edBlruPY_G4s0tcmKCeYijKenMDWVNsV'      id='img2'    />    <p id='p'>      To stem the tide of professors decamping for industry, universities are      turning to dual appointments.Last year Amazon hired Siddhartha Srinivasa,      a world-renowned robotics expert who is a computerscience professor at the      University of Washington. He now splits his time between the two.    </p>    <p id='p'>      Ed Lazowska, a computer science professor at the university, said such      arrangements gave facultymembers access to resources, like giant computing      power and tremendous data sets, that could helpfurther their research and      benefit their students.    </p>    <p id='p'>      What better place could there be than Amazon to put your robot to work?      Professor Lazowska said.Professor Fussell at Texas also said joint      appointments could be a partial remedy, adding that he had    </p>    <p id='p'>      recently talked with major tech companies about helping universities      retain faculty.They are well aware that they are eating their seed,      Professor Fussell said.    </p>    <p id='p'></p> <p id='p'></p>  <p id='p'>    Dr. Klawe at Harvey Mudd is weighing a more academic solution to meeting    student demand.

What can we say about whether;and when;nudging works and should be deployedto improve student outcomes?</p><h1 id='h1'>WHAT IS A NUDGE?</h1><p id='p'> <a  id='a' href='https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690485/nudge-by-richard-h-thaler-and-cass-r-sunstein/'>Nudging</a> refers to a wide set of interventions that guide, rather than mandate, individuals to act in acertain way. Generally, nudging encourages actions that will benefit individuals (such as increasingretirement investing) or benefit society at no meaningful cost to individuals (such as increasing blooddonations). Importantly, nudges always provide an individual the chance not to do an encouraged action.Brightly colored arrows painted on the ground leading commuters to take the stairs instead of theescalator constitutes a nudge;shutting off the escalator does not. Nudging; encompasses many designchoices, such as changing the default (e.g., changing the <a  id='a' href='https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20180279'>default loan amount</a>  offered to communitycollege students) or providing an anchor (e.g., noting how much most students borrow). In many cases,the question is not whether to nudge but how;what default loan to offer students or what order to listschools in a school choice brochure.</p><p id='p'>A common nudge strategy in education has been to send targeted information to students andfamilies;about <a  id='a' href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373720922237'>how to enroll in early childhood programs</a>, <a  id='a' href='https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ca290ca3560c3098a9a7ae9/t/5cd4c3b341920256b23551d8/1557447604698/Robinson_Lee_Dearing_Rogers%282018%29AERJ_PUBLIC_Reducing-student-absenteeism-in-the-early-grades-by-targeting-parental-beliefs.pdf'>encouraging school attendance</a>,  and <a  id='a' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268114003217'>supportingcollege attendance</a>. These interventions have expanded in recent years, with numerous randomizedcontrolled trials evaluating the efficacy of nudging approaches. The field has now reached a point ofmaturity where we can consider what works in nudging and what open questions remain to be explored.</p><h1 id='h1'>WHEN SHOULD NUDGES BE USED?</h1><p id='p'></div><div><p id='p'><p id='p'>While nudges can be effective strategies to change behavior, they are not appropriate for all policygoals. The following questions are essential for considering whether to deploy a nudge intervention:</p><p id='p'>○ Is there an intention;action gap? Do we believe that individuals want to (or could be persuaded towant to) pursue nudged activity? If yes, this is a good candidate for nudging.</p><p id='p'>○ Is the barrier to completion structural? If yes, nudging may not be enough to overcome thesestructural challenges. Consider a student who wants to attend class regularly but has <a  id='a' href='https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/10/24/lack-of-transportation-hinders-community-college-students?utm_campaign=2022-10-24+SD&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Pew&subscriberkey=003U000001bI31TIAS'>persistenttransportation issues</a>. A nudge campaign could encourage the student to review the bus schedule andmake a plan to arrive to class on time;but only if a sufficient transit system exists to take students fromtheir home to campus. Nudges have limited effectiveness in these cases.<p id='p'>○ Is the source of inaction clearly identified? If yes, customize nudges to students; specific needsand reasons for inaction. Students who dont know about a task need different messages than students</p> <p id='p'>who know about a task but dont know how to complete it.</p><h1 id='h1'>DO INFORMATIONAL NUDGES WORK?</h1><p id='p'>Informational nudges have dominated <a  id='a' href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.22123'>behavioral science applications</a> focused on college access andsuccess, with a deep literature base examining how different strategies affect college attainment. Thecollege transition is a challenging time when informational nudges can be particularly effective, asstudents adapt to life without parental or school-based support and structure for managing tasks. Once incollege, students must learn to juggle the new demands of academics and administrative requirements,often alongside work and family responsibilities, and delivering key information in a timely way can helpconnect students to resources or meet important deadlines. Students can receive these informational nudgecampaigns across all media platforms;but in recent years, text-based outreach has become a commoncommunication medium, starting as standard SMS messages and evolving into more complex messagingsystems integrating images and smart response logic.</p><p id='p'>While many of these text-based informational nudges show promising effects in local implementation,efforts to replicate and scale to larger populations often have yielded disappointing results. <a  id='a' href='https://www.nber.org/papers/w23925'>Thisphenomenon is hardly limited to nudge efforts</a>. Nevertheless, we consider here what we can learn fromvariation in the success of these efforts at scale. Take, for example, the case of refiling the FreeApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Some 15-20% of Pell grant-eligible students don;tre-submit the FAFSA. This is a clear intention-action gap where nudges can be effective;students shouldwant to maintain their federal aid but face barriers to completing the form. Researchers successfullypartnered with a non-profit to send informational nudges about FAFSA resubmission to college freshmen;as a result, <a  id='a' href='http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/51/2/389'>community college freshmen were 14 percentage points more likely to remain continuouslyenrolled into their sophomore year.</a> In this intervention, students who received these messages hadworked with the non-profit when they were high school students. Students actively engaged with themessaging and only 5% of students opted out from messaging.</p><p id='p'></div><div><p id='p'><p id='p'>Researchers tested scaling up this strategy with a national sample of about 10,000 college students whoreceived similar informational nudges about FAFSA re-filing, though sent from a non-profit with whomthey had no prior relationship. Unlike the experiment where students were familiar with the advisorssending nudges, about 25% of students opted out from messaging in the national campaign, and it <a  id='a' href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/01623737221111403'>had nooverall effect on FAFSA filing (though some students filed earlier), federal financial aid receipt, orcollege persistence</a>. Other efforts to scale up FAFSA reminders to high school students, like sendingmessages on behalf of the Common Application, similarly had no effect on aid receipt or collegeenrollment. The authors of both studies reason that local implementation may be an essential feature ofinformational nudge campaigns. Students may not take up guidance or respond to information fromsources they do not know and trust.</p><h1 id='h1'>HOW ARE SUCCESSFUL NUDGES DESIGNED?</h1><p id='p'>In recent joint work with colleagues Jeonghyun Lee and Hunter Gehlbach, we tested theimplementation of a text message chatbot; to support students after college enrollment at Georgia StateUniversity (GSU). The chatbot deployed a combination of text-based informational nudges, AI-poweredresponses to student questions, and staff intervention when the bot was unable to address a question. Thechatbot was set up to answer direct questions such as when does registration open; or to send resourcesin response to statements such as I got dropped from classes because I have a balance due; (replying, forexample, with a link and phone number for the financial aid office). A prior implementation of thechatbot helped reduce summer melt among students admitted to GSU by about three percentage points. Inthis new study, we examined whether the same communication tool could boost student persistence andretention. Importantly, we tested the chatbot with both associate degree-intending and bachelor;sdegree-intending students within the GSU system to examine whether the strategy could scale acrossdifferent contexts and student populations.</p><p id='p'>We found consistent positive effects on key predictors of persistence;filing the FAFSA and registeringfor the next term. In many instances, the chatbot encouraged students to complete these tasks earlier in thesemester. This is important since filing financial aid forms earlier in the year may result in studentsreceiving more aid (or having more time to navigate the complex FAFSA verification process).</p><p id='p'>  <img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_31KInIgJlSh4LfzJ7U26c3c8AuZNMt3' id='img2'><p id='p'><p id='p'>GSU's successful use of a chatbot to support enrolled students shares an important commonality withprior successful nudge efforts in that students were familiar with the sender;in this case, their college.Even so, not all messages affected student behavior. Mirroring best practices in nudging, the mostimpactful messages in the chatbot campaigns were ones that:</p><p id='p'>○ <b>Focused on acute tasks</b>: Messages about tasks that were serious and time-sensitive, such asresolving an outstanding balance on a semester bill or addressing an academic hold, had greater impact.</p><p id='p'>○ <b>Included actionable next steps</b>: The best-designed messages included the what; (looks like youhave a balance hold on your account;), the consequence (this will stop you from registering for summer fall;), and a call to action (dquo;You can take care of this hold through your account. For questions, emailX;).</p><p id='p'>○ <b>Targeted students</b>; specific needs: Using administrative records, GSU targeted messages tostudents for whom the content was most relevant. That meant not everyone got a reminder to file theFAFSA;only students who had not yet filed their FAFSA did. This decreased the number of messagessent and increased the relevance of the messages students received.</p><p id='p'>WHAT'S NEXT?</p><p id='p'>Nudges offer a low-cost option to support students through proactive outreach and may be especiallybeneficial at <a  id='a' href='https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/lack-of-structure-students-progress.html'>institutions enrolling large shares of students most in need of additional support</a>. However,one commonly cited concern about nudging is that they remove the sense of urgency to invest inlarger-scale support systems. Nudging should never be a substitute for larger investments, such as</p><p id='p'></div><div><p id='p'><p id='p'>increasing financial aid or hiring more student advisors. But nudges can still play a valuable role as acomplement to these investments, informing students about and encouraging them to take advantage ofadditional support.</p><p id='p'>Targeted informational nudges will likely continue to be a part of the standard student support toolkitin the coming years as higher education administrators face ongoing challenges supporting collegecompletion for ever-evolving student populations who face confusing financial aid, matriculation, andpersistence processes. Informational nudges that focus on the most acute challenges students face, targetcommunication to students; specific needs, provide students with engagement opportunities, and build ona foundation of trust and familiarity have the best potential to support students.</p><p id='p'>This article was written by Katharine Meyer and Lindsay C.

Thatequates to some 1.56 million  additional applications sent by this year's class compared to  theircounterparts in the class of 2020 although the classes are roughly the  same size.</p><p id='p'>  When I applied to college in late 1990, I recall petering out after filling  out four applications on myfamily's Smith Corona electric typewriter. Last  year, nearly one in five applicants applied to 10 or morecolleges, mostly by  pressing a button on the Common App. That's about double the proportion of  seniorswho applied to the same number of colleges just eight years ago.</p><p id='p'>  Application inflation is most acute at the nation's brand-name and top-ranked  public and private colleges,whose application numbers have ticked up 32  percent since 2020, according to the Common App. Sincenearly all these  selective colleges promise that applicants will get a holistic review, not one  based only ongrades or a test score (if submitted), their admissions staffs  are under pressure to wade through a risingpile of applications with their  essays, recommendations and laundry lists of activities in the sameamount of  time as before.</p><p id='p'>  No one has yet figured out how to add more days to January, February and  March, the months when mostapplications are reviewed during so-called regular  decision. To give themselves more breathing room,colleges have tried instead  to spread out the process with multiple submission deadlines over several</p><p id='p'>  months. More than one-third of the colleges that accept the Common App now  offer early action, whichrequires students to apply in November to typically  get a decision in January.</p><img  src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RJ-K3IS4rBu2N-tEX4JGByUzZpmaNlQl'  id='img2'/><p id='p'>Shutterstock</p><p id='p'>  Students like early action because they get a speedier response. There is  peace and solace in knowingearly, in knowing I'm in,; said Rick Clark, the  assistant vice provost and executive director ofundergraduate admission at  Georgia Tech, who is also an author of The Truth About CollegeAdmission.;</p><p id='p'>  But whenever colleges encourage anything in the game of hypercompetitive  admissions, applicantsrespond accordingly to give themselves the best shot at  getting in. In recent years, half of applicants whoused the Common App applied  early action somewhere. Sure, colleges succeeded in spreading out thearrival  of applications, but they were also getting more applications overall.</p><p id='p'>  Clemson, for example, received 26,000 applications this year for its  first-ever early action cycle and thengot an additional 32,000 regular  decision applications for a freshman class that will end up having around4,500  students. Overall, applications were up 10 percent from the previous  admissions season. TheUniversity of Southern California, which like Clemson  offered early action for the first time this year,recorded an even bigger  increase 16 percent having collected 40,000 early applications and thendoubled  that number during the regular decision cycle for a first-year class expected  to be just 3,400. TheUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison landed 45,000 early  applications, a 10 percent increase over last year.</p><p id='p'>  Now these colleges had another problem on their hands: They didn't want to  fill too much of their classesearly in case applicants they really want come  along in the regular decision pool. So instead of givingstudents peace and  solace; (as Clark said), they often didn't give them any answer. They punted  thedecision on many early applicants by telling them they were deferred to the  later regular round. Wisconsindeferred 17,000 of its 45,000 early action  applicants. U.S.C. deferred around 38,000 some 94 percent</p><p id='p'>  of its early pool. (It accepted the other 6 percent and rejected no one.)  Clemson told nearly 15,000 ofits 26,000 early applicants to wait another  two-plus months for a decision. (It rejected only 300.)While some colleges  like the University of Virginia published their deferral numbers right after  decisionswent out (it pushed 21 percent, or 7,707 early applicants, to  regular), most don't, leaving applicants in thedark about what a deferral  really means. The University of Wisconsin initially told me how many  studentsit deferred, then asked that I not publish the number but relented  when I suggested it wasn't beingtransparent with applicants.</p><p id='p'>  Why the secrecy? A spokesman said the university has a longstanding practice  of not commenting onadmissions before the class matriculates.; Um, that's in  the fall, long after admissions season is overfor this year's seniors when  they can't do anything with the information like maybe apply to somebackup  schools on their lists. Without knowing how many applicants were pushed to the  next round,teenagers who have applied to six, eight, 12 colleges might be  sitting on multiple deferrals with no idea ifthey really have a shot or if the  deferral is simply a precursor to a rejection a few months later.</p><p id='p'>  The schools that students are most interested in are often the same ones most  opaque with what adeferral really means,; said Andy Borst, the director of  undergraduate admissions at the University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champaign. I  like Borst's approach here: He sends an email to high school counselorsbefore  decisions are released to provide, as he writes, as much clarity as I can,  with supporting data.</p><p id='p'>  More colleges should provide that clarity by revealing their numbers in real  time. Or better yet, denymore students in early action so both sides can just  move on. After all, as Greg Roberts, the dean ofadmission at the University of  Virginia told me, we know the number of students who eventually emergeas  offers; from the early pool might be small.</p><p id='p'>  If I learned anything about admissions in the year I spent embedded in three  admissions offices for mylatest book, it's this: The process isn't about the  applicants, their needs or what's fair, because admissionsis a business for  colleges. Much like airline executives who try to fill as many seats on a  plane as possiblewith those paying the highest fares, colleges use their own  enrollment management tactics, such as longdeferral lists, to hedge against  increasing uncertainty in the business.</p><p id='p'>  Students can apply to 10 colleges and be accepted by all 10 but can go to only  one. Stringing alongstudents with deferrals can prove helpful to colleges  trying to boost their yield the percentage ofaccepted students who enroll or  to fill in gaps in their classes. Do they need more English majors?More  students from the Dakotas? More full payers? More men? Well, then let's go to  the deferral bin andpick out what we need.</p><img  src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1j4SEOB0RB6KbRHyTl3osqlQ3K6p4cQUT'  id='img2'/><p id='p'>  Olin Library at Wesleyan University. Bea Oyster for The New York Times</p><p id='p'>  Most admissions deans I talked with said they don't fully review the deferred  applications again duringregular decision, when they're already facing another  thick pile of files. They might look at newinformation they receive, namely  grades from senior year. Those grades can help push someone over theacceptance  line but, for the most part, only if the applicant also fulfills other  institutional priorities.</p><p id='p'>  Given the abundance of early applicants and the limited spaces available,  certainly colleges could easilydeny more of them and pull the Band-Aid off,;  as Kedra Ishop, the vice president for enrollmentmanagement at U.S.C, put it.  A deferral in early action followed by a rejection in regular is seen, by  bothadmissions officers and applicants, as a gradual letdown rather than the  shock of an outright rejection.</p><p id='p'>  Ishop echoed several other deans in telling me that a deferral is simply  informing an applicant that theselection process isn't finished (even if  students applied early precisely because they wanted it to beover). Why would  we put out a denial when the pool itself isn't settled?; Ishop asked. Then  we're notgiving students the full consideration we promise.;</p><p id='p'>  Of course, we shouldn't kid ourselves about the aura of precision that  admissions deans at selectivecolleges create around crafting a class. Cutting  some of these early action students loose would help themknow where they  stand, but it won't change the fact that in the end a sizable piece of any  freshman classat a top-ranked college is eerily similar to that of any other  highly selective campus.</p><p id='p'>  This article was written by By Jeffrey Selingo on March 16, 2023 for the New  York Times.
